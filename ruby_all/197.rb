# Problem 197: Investigating the behaviour of a recursively defined sequence
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=197

# Given is the function f(x) = ⌊2^30.403243784-x2⌋× 10^-9 ( ⌊⌋ is the floor-function),
# the sequence un is defined by u0 = -1 and un+1 = f(un).
# 
# Find un + un+1 for n = 10^12.
# Give your answer with 9 digits after the decimal point.
