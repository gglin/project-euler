# 
# Let C(r) be the sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius r.
# Let Z(r) be the set of points on the surface of C(r) with integer coordinates.
# Let T(r) be the set of spherical triangles with vertices in Z(r).
# Degenerate spherical triangles, formed by three points on the same great arc, are not included in T(r).
# Let A(r) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(r).
# 
# For example A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places.
# 
# Find http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_332_sum.gif A(r). Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.
