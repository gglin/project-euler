# Problem 368: A Kempner-like series
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=368

# 
# The  harmonic series  1
#     +12
#     +
#     13
#     +
#     14
#     + ... is well known to be divergent. 
# 
# If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.
# This modified harmonic series is called the Kempner series.
# 
# 
# Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.
# One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.
# These 20 omitted terms are:
# 
# 1111
# ,
# 1222
# ,
# 1333
# ,
# 1444
# ,
# 1555
# ,
# 1666
# ,
# 1777
# ,
# 1888
# ,
# 1999
# ,
# 11000
# ,
# 11110
# ,
# 11111
# ,
# 11112
# ,
# 11113
# ,
# 11114
# ,
# 11115
# ,
# 11116
# ,
# 11117
# ,
# 11118
#  and 
# 11119
# .
# 
# 
# This series converges as well.
# 
#  
# Find the value the series converges to.
# Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
