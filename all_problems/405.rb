# Problem 405: A rectangular tiling
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=405

# 
# We wish to tile a rectangle whose length is twice its width.
# Let T(0) be the tiling consisting of a single rectangle.
# For n > 0, let T(n) be obtained from T(n-1) by replacing all tiles in the following manner:

# The following animation demonstrates the tilings T(n) for n from 0 to 5:

# 
# 
# Let f(n) be the number of points where four tiles meet in T(n).
# For example, f(1) = 0, f(4) = 82 and f(10^9) mod 17^7 = 126897180.
# 
# 
# 
# Find f(10^k) for k = 10^18, give your answer modulo 17^7.
