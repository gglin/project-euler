# Problem 421: Prime factors of n15+1
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=421

# 
# Numbers of the form n^15+1 are composite for every integer n > 1.
# For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the distinct prime factors of n^15+1 not exceeding m.
# 
# E.g. 2^15+1 = 3×3×11×331.
# So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.
# 
# Also 10^15+1 = 7×11×13×211×241×2161×9091.
# So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.
# Find &Sum; s(n,10^8) for 1 ≤n ≤ 10^11.
