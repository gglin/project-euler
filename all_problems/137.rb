# Problem 137: Fibonacci golden nuggets
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=137

# 
# Consider the infinite polynomial series AF(x) = xF1 + x^2F2 + x^3F3 + ..., where Fk is the kth term in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ; that is, Fk = Fk−1 + Fk−2, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
# For this problem we shall be interested in values of x for which AF(x) is a positive integer.
# Surprisingly AF(1/2)
#  = 
# (1/2).1 + (1/2)^2.1 + (1/2)^3.2 + (1/2)^4.3 + (1/2)^5.5 + ...
#  
#  = 
# 1/2 + 1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 5/32 + ...
#  
#  = 
# 2
# The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.
# 
# xAF(x)
# √2−11
# 1/22
# (√13−2)/33
# (√89−5)/84
# (√34−3)/55
# 
# We shall call AF(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 10th golden nugget is 74049690.
# Find the 15th golden nugget.
