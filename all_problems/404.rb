# Problem 404: Crisscross Ellipses
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=404

# 
# Ea is an ellipse with an equation of the form x^2 + 4y^2 = 4a^2.
# Ea' is the rotated image of Ea by θ degrees counterclockwise around the origin O(0, 0) for 0° < θ < 90°.

# 
# b is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to the origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection points.
# We call an ordered triplet (a, b, c) a canonical ellipsoidal triplet if a, b and c are positive integers.
# For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.
# 
# 
# 
# Let C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b, c) for a ≤N.
# It can be verified that C(10^3) = 7, C(10^4) = 106 and C(10^6) = 11845.
# 
# 
# 
# Find C(10^17).
