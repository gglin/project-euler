# Problem 194: Coloured Configurations
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=194

# Consider graphs built with the units A: http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_194_GraphA.png
# and B: http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_194_GraphB.png, where the units are glued along
# the vertical edges as in the graph http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_194_Fig.png.
# 
# A configuration of type (a,b,c) is a graph thus built of a units A and b units B, where the graph's vertices are coloured using up to c colours, so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.
# The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type (2,2,6), in fact of type (2,2,c) for all c ≥ 4.
# 
# Let N(a,b,c) be the number of configurations of type (a,b,c).
# For example, N(1,0,3) = 24, N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736.
# 
# Find the last 8 digits of N(25,75,1984).
