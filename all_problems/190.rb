# Problem 190: Maximising a weighted product

# http://projecteuler.net/problem=190

# Let Sm = (x1, x2, ... , xm) be the m-tuple of positive real numbers with x1 + x2 + ... + xm = m for which Pm = x1 * x2^2 * ... * xm^m is maximised.
# 
# For example, it can be verified that [P10] = 4112 ([ ] is the integer part function).
# 
# Find Σ[Pm] for 2 ≤ m ≤ 15.
