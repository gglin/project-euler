# Problem 390: Triangles with non rational sides and integral area
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=390

# Consider the triangle with sides √5, √65 and √68.
# It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.
# 
# S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides √(1+b^2), √(1+c^2) and √(b^2+c^2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.
# 
# The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.
# 
# S(10^6)=18018206.
# 
# Find S(10^10).
