# A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.
# Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:

# 
# 
# We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.
# We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.
# 
# 
# 
# Find F(10^7).
