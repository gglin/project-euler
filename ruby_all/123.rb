# Problem 123: Prime square remainders
# http://projecteuler.net/problem=123

# 
# Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (pn−1)^n + (pn+1)^n is divided by pn^2.
# For example, when n = 3, p3 = 5, and 4^3 + 6^3 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.
# The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^9 is 7037.
# Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^10.
